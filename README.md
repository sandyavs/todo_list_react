# Todo List Application
## Description
Goal is to make use of React functional components and the useState hook to make a simple to-do list application that is well-structured, with separate sections for input fields, heading display, list display, and add list functionality.

## Learning Objectives
- Manage state in a React functional component using the useState hook. State variables such as `todos`, `headingInput`, and `listInput` are used to maintain the state of the Todo List and user input fields.
- Render headings and associated lists based on the state maintained by React's useState hook.
- Implemented event handling functions to add new headings and lists, and to handle changes in input fields.
- Performed CRUD operations: Creating todo's, Reading todo's, Deleting todo's
